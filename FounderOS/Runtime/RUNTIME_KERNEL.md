# FRE — RUNTIME KERNEL

## Purpose

Define the universal execution cycle that every FounderHQ runtime implements. The kernel is platform-independent and LLM-independent.

## Identity

The kernel is the decision cycle. It transforms observation into action and action into learning. It is the heartbeat of FounderHQ.

## The Kernel Cycle

```
BOOT

OBSERVE
  ↓
ORIENT
  ↓
DECIDE
  ↓
ACT
  ↓
LEARN
  ↓
UPDATE
  ↓
(repeat from OBSERVE)
```

## Phase 1: BOOT

Execute once per session, before any other phase.

Operations:
1. Load State/CURRENT_STATE.md
2. Load State/PRIORITY_MATRIX.md
3. Load State/WATCH_REGISTRY.md
4. Compute datetime in Lomé UTC+0
5. Scan all concept footers for staleness (>48h)
6. Report: datetime, mode (SURVIVAL/GROWTH/SCALE), top priority, stale concepts

Output: Session awareness established.

## Phase 2: OBSERVE

Receive and process input from the founder or the environment.

Operations:
1. Receive raw input (message, file change, time trigger)
2. Scan input against INFO_CAPTURE_PROTOCOL mapping
3. Capture any operational data found into appropriate files
4. Classify input into an action type (DECISION_GATES)

Output: Cleaned, classified input ready for orientation.

## Phase 3: ORIENT

Understand what the input means in the current context.

Operations:
1. Load relevant concepts for the classified action type
2. Verify freshness of loaded concepts
3. Scan all active projects in PRIORITY_MATRIX for data room completeness
4. Flag any contradictions between files
5. Check current constraints: cash, energy, time, blockers

Output: Situational awareness with flagged risks.

## Phase 4: DECIDE

Choose the single highest-leverage action.

Operations:
1. Apply DECISION_GATES: is this financial, legal, external?
2. Apply PRIORITIZATION_PROTOCOL: is this the right action NOW?
3. If SURVIVAL mode and DIRECT classification: auto-generate action module
4. If escalation required: present options with recommendation, await decision
5. Select one action

Output: A clear, constrained decision.

## Phase 5: ACT

Execute the selected action.

Operations:
1. Load the relevant module (DIOS, VAOS, CEOS, etc.)
2. Load the relevant workflow if applicable
3. Execute the action
4. Document the execution

Output: Action completed.

## Phase 6: LEARN

Extract lessons from the action and its outcome.

Operations:
1. What worked?
2. What didn't?
3. What surprised us?
4. Is there a pattern?
5. Is there a new playbook?

Output: Knowledge captured.

## Phase 7: UPDATE

Persist all changes to files.

Operations:
1. Update CURRENT_STATE.md with new operational state
2. Update TIMELINE.md (Event → Decision → Outcome)
3. Update KNOWLEDGE.md with validated lessons
4. Update affected concept files
5. Save session objective and next-session priority

Output: State preserved for next session.

## Kernel Principles

1. **LLM is a component** — the kernel cycles regardless of which LLM executes it
2. **Pass by reference** — can skip phases if input demands immediate action (e.g., "stop")
3. **No phase skipping without flag** — if a phase is skipped, it must be declared
4. **Cash-aware** — if cash < 1,500 FCFA, DECIDE must prioritize revenue generation
5. **File-based** — all outputs are persisted to files before the next cycle
